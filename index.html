      <h2>Who is this guy?</h2>
      <p>My name is Keller Flint and I live in Auburn Washington.
        I love mountains almost as much as I love computers. I spend most of my time
        hiking in the PNW and teaching coding to anyone willing
        to learn. Now if only I could find a way to do both at once...</p>

      <h2>Why coding and mountains?</h2>
      <p>Coding is the greatest thing ever. It’s quite literally a superpower.
        It allows us to understand and control the invisible streams of information that shape our lives.
        It gives us the power to build stunning virtual worlds limited only by our own imagination.
        Best of all, it to lets us solve important problems for real people.
        Coding has the power to change the world on a scale that only abstracted autonomous instruction sets truly
        can.
      </p>
      <p>
        And mountains are just plain awesome in a very self explanatory way. No need for further discussion.
      </p>

      <h2>But seriously, what do you do?</h2>
      <p>Since computers are so cool that they’re basically magic,
        I’ve spent all four years of my adult life working to learn as much as I can and
        teaching computer science to anyone who will let me. Right now I am a student at
        Green River College pursuing a Bachelors of Applied Science in Software Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I’ve also run a number of coding summer camps, clubs,
        after school programs and other coding based educational activities for students of all ages. From tutoring
        adults in data structures and algorithms in Java to introducing elementary schoolers to block coding, I’m more
        than willing
        to teach anyone with a few working arms and a little interest how to code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I work for the Auburn Rec Center running game design makerspaces and teaching introductory
        programming and for Green River as a tutor for the Software Development program. I'm also interning for Avanade
        this summer as a full stack developer.
