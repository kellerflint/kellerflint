        <h3>Do humanities students need to learn to code?</h3>
        <p>
          This seems to be the big question that everyone is all fired up about. But I don’t think this question actually reflects the dilemma that the humanities face when it comes to computer science. The way I see it, the question at the heart of the discussion is this: How should curriculum prepare humanities students to work with computer technology? And the answer to that question is not as simple as just learning to write code.
          Most problems that humanities students (or most users for that matter) encounter are not going to take writing a single line of code to fix. And even if they do encounter a problem that would require some real coding knowledge, it is likely to be either something they are capable of solving through normal troubleshooting or an issue that a software’s dev team should address.
        </p>
        <h3>Software != Code </h3>
        <p>
          Most software exists so that you don’t have to know how to code to use it. That’s kinda the point of software; to make sure that you don’t have to go through all the nonsense that the developers did in order to use their product. I sure hope I don’t need to learn to code to use the next version of PowerPoint or Microsoft has done something horribly wrong.
          My point is that 9 times out of 10, problems are solvable using tools that already exist. I work for Academic Technology and a large part of my job is to solve problems that humanities professors have with software. Seriously, it’s at least half of what I do. So how do you think I solve most of the issues I’m faced with? I can tell you I sure don’t hop on my computer and bang out some Moodle plugins every time someone wants some change or new feature. In almost every instance there is already software to do what they want. My job is to show them that it exists and help them learn to use it. And when a problem with that software emerges, do I need to go into the source code to figure out what’s wrong? Not for what I get paid! I google it and I read tech forums and I ask questions and in 99% of cases I don’t have to write a line of code to fix the problem.
        </p>
        <h3>Am I saying that we shouldn’t try to teach everyone to code?</h3>
        <p>
          NO!!! If you’ve read my about page then you’ll know I’ve done everything I can to teach kids to code including starting my own summer program for it! I love coding. I love teaching it to people. I love it when they love it. But realistically, troubleshooting is a far more important skill because being able to code does not magically give you the ability to understand intricate details about complex software.
          For instance, I’ve been writing code since I was in 6th grade. I’ve spent years programing in Java, python and C#. Yet I still spent over two hours last night trying to remove the sidebar on a wordpress website. What did my amazing coding skills get me? Hours of work only to eventually come to the realization that I’d have to make some serious modifications to the server PHP to achieve the result I wanted. How did I figure this out? Certainly not with my more or less nonexistent understanding of web design. I figured it out because I knew how to google the problem until I found an answer from someone who actually knew what they were doing. And if I do decide that I want to go back and remove that side bar, my coding knowledge might be somewhat useful but I’m no PHP expert (at least not yet). Instead, I’d head over to google and scrape together enough of a solution (i.e. copy-paste smarter people’s code) until WordPress did what I wanted.
        </p>
        <h3>So how should curriculum prepare humanities students to work with computer technology?</h3>
        <p>
          I’d say it needs to prepare students enough so that they have the power to not only to work with the current digital technologies, but also with the technologies of the future that we’ve only begun to imagine. It's less about learning to code and more about understanding digital frameworks and their limitations. Maybe that means all students should be taking an intro CS course. Maybe it means colleges should create a mandatory troubleshooting 101 class (I’m sure that would go over well). Or maybe it’s students taking it upon themselves to learn and prepare. Here’s the point: Future job security and technological relevance it isn’t going to be about knowing how to write some ancient 2017 version of JavaScript. It’s going to be about a person’s ability to problem solving and find workable solutions even when they don’t have a clue what they’re doing.

        <h3>My Garbage Security</h3>
        <p>
          I <i>know</i> that I should be backing up my computer on a regular basis and I <i>know</i> that using the same password for many of my accounts is a risk. In fact, I’ve been meaning to fix both of those problems for the past two years. However during my summer training at Academic Technology, I heard a great talk about data security where I both learned, and was reminded of, a few important steps that I need to take in order to secure my data.
        </p>
        <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
          <h4>#1: Backups rule</h4>
        <p>
          I’ve lost my share of data over the years (mostly due to a lack of respect for the great and terrible powers of Disk Utility). Fortunately for me, that data was rarely important. However our data security training was a great reminder that, at this point in my life, my computer is filled with more important information than “the top 10 Minecraft mods of 2012.” From financial info about college expenses that I’d rather ignore, to family pictures that my mother tells me I’m not smiling in, these aren’t files I can just re-download if something goes wrong.
        </p>
        <h4>#2: I will care about archives… someday</h4>
        <p>
          I never really worried about archiving files, mostly because I’ve never had the experience of wanting any of my old middle school essays back. I feel a lot better knowing those are lost to history. But as time goes on, more and more of the work I do could be relevant to my future. For instance, I should have kept a copy of every paper I’ve written over the last year for my Writing Portfolio. But do I have them? Well, probably some of them. Where are they? I’ll get back to you on that after an afternoon of frantically scouring my computer.
        </p>
          <h4>#3: I have SO MANY passwords to change</h4>
        <p>
          I have a great password. It’s 16 characters long with a variety numbers, letters, and symbols. Even better, I’ve used it so frequently that I can type it in the blink of an eye. In fact, it’s such a great password that I’ve used it for dozens of different sites. I think that I was vaguely aware that using a single password for many important accounts was a bad idea but it didn’t really sink in until I read one of the xkcd comics in our data security training. Suddenly the possibility that I could have used my super password for any number of less-than-secure accounts seemed all too real. I guess I know how I’m going to spend the last few days of summer!
        </p>

        <h3>Steps I've Taken</h3>
        <p>
          In order to prevent both hackers and hardware failure from destroying my life, I have implemented the following changes to better secure my data.
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Migrated all of my important documents to the cloud using a combination of Dropbox and Google Drive
            </li>
            <li>
              Created and backed up archives of all the important documents I might need someday
            </li>
            <li>
              Installed LastPass to manage the passwords across my various accounts
            </li>
            <li>
              Begun the arduous process of coming up with different and unique passwords for my most important accounts
            </li>
            <li>
              Purchased a security key for two factor authentication on any account that support it
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overall, my security is infinitely better for our data security training. It lead me to reconsider my security and make a variety of changes to better safeguard my data in the future. Thanks Paula!
