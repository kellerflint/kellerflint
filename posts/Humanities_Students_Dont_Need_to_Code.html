    <h3>Do humanities students need to learn to code?</h3>
    <p>
        This seems to be the big question that everyone is all fired up about. But I don’t think this question actually
        reflects the dilemma that the humanities face when it comes to computer science. The way I see it, the question
        at the heart of the discussion is this: How should curriculum prepare humanities students to work with computer
        technology? And the answer to that question is not as simple as just learning to write code.
        Most problems that humanities students (or most users for that matter) encounter are not going to take writing
        a single line of code to fix. And even if they do encounter a problem that would require some real coding
        knowledge, it is likely to be either something they are capable of solving through normal troubleshooting or an
        issue that a software’s dev team should address.

    <h3>Software != Code </h3>
    <p>
        Most software exists so that you don’t have to know how to code to use it. That’s kinda the point of software;
        to make sure that you don’t have to go through all the nonsense that the developers did in order to use their
        product. I sure hope I don’t need to learn to code to use the next version of PowerPoint or Microsoft has done
        something horribly wrong.
        My point is that 9 times out of 10, problems are solvable using tools that already exist. I work for Academic
        Technology and a large part of my job is to solve problems that humanities professors have with software.
        Seriously, it’s at least half of what I do. So how do you think I solve most of the issues I’m faced with? I
        can tell you I sure don’t hop on my computer and bang out some Moodle plugins every time someone wants some
        change or new feature. In almost every instance there is already software to do what they want. My job is to
        show them that it exists and help them learn to use it. And when a problem with that software emerges, do I
        need to go into the source code to figure out what’s wrong? Not for what I get paid! I google it and I read
        tech forums and I ask questions and in 99% of cases I don’t have to write a line of code to fix the problem.

    <h3>Am I saying that we shouldn’t try to teach everyone to code?</h3>
    <p>
        NO!!! If you’ve read my about page then you’ll know I’ve done everything I can to teach kids to code including
        starting my own summer program for it! I love coding. I love teaching it to people. I love it when they love
        it. But realistically, troubleshooting is a far more important skill because being able to code does not
        magically give you the ability to understand intricate details about complex software.
        For instance, I’ve been writing code since I was in 6th grade. I’ve spent years programing in Java, python and
        C#. Yet I still spent over two hours last night trying to remove the sidebar on a wordpress website. What did
        my amazing coding skills get me? Hours of work only to eventually come to the realization that I’d have to make
        some serious modifications to the server PHP to achieve the result I wanted. How did I figure this out?
        Certainly not with my more or less nonexistent understanding of web design. I figured it out because I knew how
        to google the problem until I found an answer from someone who actually knew what they were doing. And if I do
        decide that I want to go back and remove that side bar, my coding knowledge might be somewhat useful but I’m no
        PHP expert (at least not yet). Instead, I’d head over to google and scrape together enough of a solution (i.e.
        copy-paste smarter people’s code) until WordPress did what I wanted.

    <h3>So how should curriculum prepare humanities students to work with computer technology?</h3>
    <p>
        I’d say it needs to prepare students enough so that they have the power to not only to work with the current
        digital technologies, but also with the technologies of the future that we’ve only begun to imagine. It's less
        about learning to code and more about understanding digital frameworks and their limitations. Maybe that means
        all students should be taking an intro CS course. Maybe it means colleges should create a mandatory
        troubleshooting 101 class (I’m sure that would go over well). Or maybe it’s students taking it upon themselves
        to learn and prepare. Here’s the point: Future job security and technological relevance it isn’t going to be
        about knowing how to write some ancient 2017 version of JavaScript. It’s going to be about a person’s ability
        to problem solving and find workable solutions even when they don’t have a clue what they’re doing.
