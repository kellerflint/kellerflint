    <h3>My Garbage Security</h3>
    <p>
        I <i>know</i> that I should be backing up my computer on a regular basis and I <i>know</i> that using the same
        password for many of my accounts is a risk. In fact, I’ve been meaning to fix both of those problems for the
        past
        two years. However during my summer training at Academic Technology, I heard a great talk about data security
        where
        I both learned, and was reminded of, a few important steps that I need to take in order to secure my data.
    </p>
    <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
    <h4>#1: Backups rule</h4>
    <p>
        I’ve lost my share of data over the years (mostly due to a lack of respect for the great and terrible powers of
        Disk Utility). Fortunately for me, that data was rarely important. However our data security training was a
        great
        reminder that, at this point in my life, my computer is filled with more important information than “the top 10
        Minecraft mods of 2012.” From financial info about college expenses that I’d rather ignore, to family pictures
        that
        my mother tells me I’m not smiling in, these aren’t files I can just re-download if something goes wrong.
    </p>
    <h4>#2: I will care about archives… someday</h4>
    <p>
        I never really worried about archiving files, mostly because I’ve never had the experience of wanting any of my
        old
        middle school essays back. I feel a lot better knowing those are lost to history. But as time goes on, more and
        more of the work I do could be relevant to my future. For instance, I should have kept a copy of every paper
        I’ve
        written over the last year for my Writing Portfolio. But do I have them? Well, probably some of them. Where are
        they? I’ll get back to you on that after an afternoon of frantically scouring my computer.
    </p>
    <h4>#3: I have SO MANY passwords to change</h4>
    <p>
        I have a great password. It’s 16 characters long with a variety numbers, letters, and symbols. Even better,
        I’ve
        used it so frequently that I can type it in the blink of an eye. In fact, it’s such a great password that I’ve
        used
        it for dozens of different sites. I think that I was vaguely aware that using a single password for many
        important
        accounts was a bad idea but it didn’t really sink in until I read one of the xkcd comics in our data security
        training. Suddenly the possibility that I could have used my super password for any number of less-than-secure
        accounts seemed all too real. I guess I know how I’m going to spend the last few days of summer!
    </p>

    <h3>Steps I've Taken</h3>
    <p>
        In order to prevent both hackers and hardware failure from destroying my life, I have implemented the following
        changes to better secure my data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Migrated all of my important documents to the cloud using a combination of Dropbox and Google Drive
        </li>
        <li>
            Created and backed up archives of all the important documents I might need someday
        </li>
        <li>
            Installed LastPass to manage the passwords across my various accounts
        </li>
        <li>
            Begun the arduous process of coming up with different and unique passwords for my most important accounts
        </li>
        <li>
            Purchased a security key for two factor authentication on any account that support it
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Overall, my security is infinitely better for our data security training. It lead me to reconsider my security
        and
        make a variety of changes to better safeguard my data in the future. Thanks Paula!
