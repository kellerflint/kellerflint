            <h2>Makerspaces</h2>
            <p>I’ve always believed that the best way to learn anything is to do it and coding is no exception.
                Students in my game design makerspaces will spend most of their time working on projects and very little
                time listening to me talk. My job is not to force students to learn or babysit their progress. It is to
                give them the resources and support they need to succeed at their own pace and on their own terms.
            </p>

            <p>If you’re interested in imagining, coding and creating games, I run several game development makerspaces
                through the Auburn Parks and Recreation department. Information and signup can be found <a
                    href="https://apm.activecommunities.com/auburnwa/Activity_Search?txtActivitySearch=Computer%20Kids&applyFiltersDefaultValue=true&cat=Activities">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>I built a site for students in my makerspaces to provide them resources and track their progress. If you
                would like to see the coding resources I use (or if you are in one of my classes and forgot the link) it
                can be found at <a href="https://mymakersite.com">mymakersite.com</a>. Feel free to use “guestuser” and
                “1234” to sign in and take a look at
                what we’ve got so far!</p>

            <h2>Advanced Coding Classes
            </h2>

            <p>In the past I’ve run classes and makerspaces for more advanced topics in web development and scripting
                languages for middle and high schoolers. Typically these don’t draw enough students to warrant full
                classes so for now if you’re interested in advanced development, check out the tutoring section.</p>

            <h2>Tutoring</h2>
            <p>I offer tutoring services for self-motivated students of any age interested in really getting into coding
                and development. My goal for these sessions is to make students very good at writing code while giving
                them as much freedom as possible in choosing the types of languages and projects that most interest
                them. I have very high expectations of students I work with one-on-one and will ask for some time
                commitment outside of our sessions in the form of working on assigned projects and typing practice (if
                they can’t touch type yet).
            </p>

            <p>I’ve tutored students from ages 8 to 58 and anywhere from “absolute beginner” to “college ITS student” in
                coding ability. I don’t care in the slightest where you’re starting from, only that you care and are
                willing to put in the work.</p>

            <p>I typically charge $30 an hour for tutoring. If that’s a little too expensive and/or if you would like
                tutoring for more than one student during a session, I charge and additional $5 per hour per person (for
                instance 3 students would be $40 an hour total but $13 for each).</p>

            <p>I really enjoy working with students one on one as it gives us a chance to get into the kind of high
                level programming that will have substantial application to their lives and future work. Get in touch if
                that’s something you’re interested in!</p>

            <h2>Senior Technology Classes and Support</h2>
            <p>I sometimes run technology classes as a volunteer for the Auburn Senior Center. Right now are there are no active sessions.
            </p>

            <p>I’m interested in expand this service to retirement housing and other senior centers in need. If this is
                something that interests you, please get in touch! Otherwise, stay tuned for more information on these
                programs as they develop.</p>

            <h2>Software Development</h2>
            <p>Obviously I can also write code but that's not really the aspect of my services this site is focused on.
                Reguardless, if you are interested in my various programming projects, check out my GitHub.</p>
