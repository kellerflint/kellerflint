            <h2>Classes and Makerspaces</h2>
            <p>Most of my work right now revolves around running Makerspaces for programming and game
                development. Right now I have a game development class using Scratch for 3-5th grade and one using
                GameMaker Stuido 2 intended mainly for middle schoolers. These programs are run through Auburn
                Parks and Recreation and if you're interested in attending, information and signup for sessions can be
                found here. I sometimes also offer higher level programming classes such as web development if there's
                enough students interested to warrent a full class.</p>

            <h2>Tutoring</h2>
            <p>I offer tutoring services for self-motivated students interested in really getting into coding and
                development. My goal for these sessions is to make students very good at writing code while giving them
                as much freedom as possible in choosing the types of languages and projects that will most interest
                them. I have much higher expectations of students I work with one-on-one and will ask for at least some
                time commitment outside of our sessions in the form of working at home on assigned projects and/or
                touch typing practice (something I consider a prerequisite to doing real coding projects).
            </p>

            <p>I have tutored students from ages 8 to 58 and anywhere from absolute beginner to college IT student in
                coding ability. I really enjoy working with students one on one as it gives us a chance to get into the
                kinds of high level programming that can have substantial application to their lives and future work.
                So definitely get in touch if that’s something you’re interested in!</p>


            <h2>Senior Tech Support</h2>
            <p>I had an idea sometime ago to start offering technology classes and computer support for seniors but
                it's been taking longer than I expected to setup.
                I'm hoping to get that going sometime in the next few months so stay tuned.</p>

            <h2>Software Development</h2>
            <p>Obviously I can also write code but that's not really the aspect of my services this site is focused on.
                Reguardless, if you are interested in my various programming projects, check out my GitHub.</p>
